# PyBer_Analysis

- **Overview of the analysis**
 
The purpose of this project is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. This file will include Pandas and Matplotlib that will create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally the analysis report summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by Pyber decision-makers.

- **Results**
- Summary DataFrame
The rural rideshare information reveals they have the lest amount of drivers and rides.
Although, they earn the most for average fare per ride and	average driver fares the drivers earn the least for totals fares.

The suburban rideshare information reveals they are in 2nd place when it involves the amount of drivers, rides, totals fares, average fare per ride, and average driver fares.

Finally, the urban rideshare information reveals they have the most amount of drivers, rides and earn the most for total fares. However, when it involves the average fare per ride and average driver fares the lest amount of income  is made.

A new DataFrame was created by using the loc method on the following date range: 2019-01-01 through 2019-04-28. Time conversion = January 1, 2019 - April 28, 2019.

- A multiple-line chart was created to complement the DataFrame.


- **Summary**
The analysis report calculates  the rural, suburban, and urban ride-share services.
Although, the rural community drivers can earn the most. Some rural communities would greatly benefit  from ride-share programs that helps the lower income families that live their. 

The suburban community drivers earn the 2nd highest wage.
Most people living in the suburbs have some form of transportation. Special occasion promotions would attrack them to reserve rides.

Urban communities have changing environments. Depending on the development of the area you can easily walk to were you need to make a purchase and go home. However, some people would greatly benefit  from having a rideshare that allows them to get their purchases back home safely.
